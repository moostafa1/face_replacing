# Basic face masking project for replacing faces




# Project Overview

This project focuses on opencv library usage and haarcascade face detector to determine person's face position
to be able to change it with another's person face.


### Running the program

I used Atom editor to run this code, you can use any preferred editor to do this.

### Program Details

This project is built to masking human face on another's body, something like photoshop but 
it's mechanical, it takes two images (preferred to be with same sizes) each of then contains a person in it 
then the first image body is returned with second person's face.

input: 
* Two images
